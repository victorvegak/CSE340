<%# The Content Heading
Implement a value for the <title> elemnt that describes the content of the view associated with a <h1> Heading
building the title value in the controller, and passing it as a name-value pair to the view.
 We will take advantage of that, to use the same value as our main content heading.  %>

<% if (title) { %>
<h1><%= title %></h1>
<% } else {
  res.redirect('/')
} %>


<%# A message Block 
By adding the capacity to display a message, we're future-proofing our view. %>

<%# messages() %>


<%# The Inventory Items Display
This code block is the main content delivery mechanism for the view. 
The reason is that the view is meant to display content, not necessarily to contain logic %>

<%- grid %>
